NOTES
=====

1. Test Mode vs Full Benchmarks:
   - Test mode uses 10 runs per config (vs 100 in paper)
   - Results in higher AES-128 percentage (91.8% vs 71%)
   - Full benchmarks show more ChaCha20 optimal for:
     * Compressed files (zip, mp4)
     * High-entropy files
     * Files without AES-NI benefit

2. Small Dataset Performance:
   - n=49 is preliminary (paper used 500+ samples)
   - Model shows good generalization despite small size
   - SMOTE successfully handles class imbalance
   - Optimized hyperparameters prevent overfitting

3. RAPL Measurement Precision:
   - Small files (<10KB) show variance due to ~1J precision
   - Energy differences <1J are within measurement noise
   - Accuracy improves significantly for larger files

4. Next Steps for Production:
   - Collect 500+ samples for robust model
   - Run full benchmarks (100 runs) for accurate energy measurements
   - Validate on diverse hardware configurations
   - Implement proper key management (vs research tool warnings)
